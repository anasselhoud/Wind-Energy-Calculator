# Wind Power Calculator
Implementing an algorithm which solves Non-linear differential equations of Fluid dynamics to calculate the Wing power generated by a wind turbine. We can change the parameters and predict the wind power values tha could be generated by a specific wind turbine in a specific area. 


## Example
We test our algorithm on a specific wind turbine with the parameters mentionned in the Matlab script. The results are shown in the figure bellow
