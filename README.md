# Wind Energy Calculator
Implementing an algorithm which solves Non-linear differential equations of Fluid dynamics to calculate the Wind energy or wind power generated by a wind turbine. We can change the parameters and predict the wind power values that could be generated by a specific wind turbine in a specific area (the algorithm calculates the wind power for each velocity range).

## Detailed Report
You can check the study report (pdf file) [Link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hL4YWATrgHKx_iDgWh9qz9VY5nDW7krG/view?usp=sharing). It contains detailed information of the method we followed to model our problem numerically. 

## Example
We test our algorithm on a specific wind turbine. The parameters (radius, distance between the center of the rotor and the extrem point of the blade...) are mentionned in the Matlab script. The results are shown in the figure bellow
